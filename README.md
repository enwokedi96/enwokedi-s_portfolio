It contains the following sections:  about me,  coding projects(specifically frontend projects), curriculim vitae and various contact channels.

PS: And while the current overview look sparse, more exciting projects and deployments will be added in the nearest future.

Top of the page provides navigation tools allowing user to easily access sections in the body and at the bottom, there is a return to top button.
The 'position' property is also set to sticky for section titles, allowing user to easily track current section while perusing. 
The works in the 'coding-projects' section all link to other deployed repos and once clicked are opened in a new tab. 
In addition, google doc containing cv was embedded in the 'curriculum vitae' section and is easily readable by in-frame scrolling.

The general webpage is made responsive when window is constricted to width of 600 pixels. All containing cells are 'flex'  enabled.
