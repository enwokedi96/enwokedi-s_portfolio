This repo contains my portfolio which details my educational background and extensive experience. 
It contains the following sections:  about me,  coding projects(specifically frontend projects), curriculim vitae and various contact channels.

PS: And while the current overview look sparse, more exciting projects and deployments will be added in the nearest future.
